                <p>As a young knight, bold Sir Roland vanquished the fabled Jade Knight, and for a brief moment his eyes pierced the veil between worlds. He beheld the Valkyrie Hypernia as she lifted up his defeated foe. Overcome by her beauty, Roland dedicated his life to gaining glory in hopes of seeing the Valkyrie again.</p>
                <p>For the next fifty years, the proud, bullheaded and charming Roland won more victories, made more enemies and broke more hearts than any knight of his time. His single-handed storming of the Fortress of Alsburg inspired forty-seven epic ballads and a Lifetime miniseries. Bards wrote songs about the song he wrote commemorating his victory over the Bilious Fire Drake.</p>
                <p>As an old man on his deathbed, Roland finally beheld Hypernia again. She could not allow a natural death to keep such a warrior from Sawallha, so, with a ghost of a smile, she punched him herself so he could die in battle and she could offer him a seat in the hall of glory.</p>
                <p>No one in Sawallha feels a greater thirst for victory in the tournament than Sir Roland. He rejoices with every win and rages at every loss.</p>
